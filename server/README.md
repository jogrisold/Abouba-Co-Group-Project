This project was part of the Concordia Bootcamps MERN Full Stack Diploma.

The purpose of the Project was to create a functioning E-Commerce website
with a RESTful backend whilst simulating working in teams with appropriate
branch planning and orchestrated pushes to main.

For context, Abouba is the name of one of the group members, who was known
for being incredibly animated and likeable in his questioning of the lead
instructor of the course.
